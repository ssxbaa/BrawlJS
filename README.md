# ✨ • BrawlJS

Brawl JS is a free bot written in JavaScript that you can selfhost and use. It's ready to use since you only have to change the config file and it's ready to go.

# 🎈 • Credits

Don't remove the credits in the code because they support me by making more people find out about my code.

# 📝 • Prerequisites

- NodeJS
- A Brawl Stars API key (you can get it [here](https://developer.brawlstars.com/#/))
- A Telegram Bot (create it from @BotFather)

# 💻 • Tutorial
